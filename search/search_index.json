Most existing global degradation normalization approaches (global in the sense of being across-genes, across-samples) can be ineffective in correcting RNA degradation bias. A key result from running DegNorm is the adjustment of read counts for transcript degradation heterogeneity on a per-gene, per-sample basis while simultaneously controlling for sequencing depth. Underlying the DegNorm pipeline is the rank-one over-approximation of a gene's coverage matrix , or, the matrix of per-sample, per-nucleotide-aligned reads. For each gene DegNorm will estimate an envelope function and a scale factor for each sample. Samples whose true coverage curve lies well below their estimated coverage curve are considered degraded, and are assigned a degradation index score (or, DI score) of between 0 and 1. Batch effects can be captured by comparing the distribution of DI scores between samples. The DegNorm pipeline is comprised of the following steps Load in sorted .bam files . DegNorm also requires bam index (.bai) files - these can be created for you if samtools is in your $PATH . DegNorm will determine whether the RNA-Seq experiment was obtained from a paired read or single read platform. Parse a genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff). DegNorm determines the relative start and end positions of each gene transcript and each exon comprising each gene on each chromosome. Genes occurring on multiple chromosomes and exons occurring on multiple genes are removed. The total number of genes is referred to as n . Compute the chromosome-wide coverage for each experiment. DegNorm does not use standard coverage tools (e.g. geneomecov ) that do not take into account paired read overlap when computing coverage - here, every match segment of a read's CIGAR score augments nucleotide coverage, excluding paired read overlap. For each experiment, for each chromosome, we save coverage in a compressed Numpy array. There are p experiments. Assess per-gene read counts by counting the number of paired reads falling entirely within the start and end position of every gene. The read count matrix is a n x p matrix. Break up chromosome coverage matrices into per-gene coverage matrices . Gene matrices are saved to pickle file (a serialized data format for Python), one .pkl file per chromosome.

You can access it through the degnorm command. Inputs You only need two types of files to supply degnorm : .bam (and their corresponding .bai files - bam index files ), and a .gtf file. If you have samtools in your $PATH , .bai files will be created for you if you do not have them. 1. (Paired or single end) aligned and sorted reads data At least two aligned reads files must be specieid, as inter-sample degradation normalization can't happen on a standalone RNA-Seq expermient. Use p to refer to the total number of experiments. It is assumed your .bam files are sorted (i.e. with samtools sort ), contain a header, and abide by the conventions . If .bai files are not submitted, degnorm will look for .bai files named after the .bam files only with the \".bai\" extension. If no such file is found, degnorm will attempt to build one with the samtools index command. This will only work if the .bam files are sorted. Instead of specifying individual .bam and .bai files, you can just specify --bam-dir , a path to a directory holding the relevant .bam and .bai files. With --bam-dir , it is assumed that the .bai files are named the same as the .bam files, they just have a different extension. You can supply paired reads files or single end reads files . Argument Required? Meaning --bam-files If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bam files --bai-files If samtools is not in the $PATH and neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bai files. If specified, they must be in the order corresponding to --bam-files . --bam-dir If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-files are specified Directory containing .bam and .bai files for a pipeline run. It is assumed the .bai files are named after the .bam files. -u , --unique-alignments optional flag If specified, tells degnorm to remove reads aligned to more than one location on the genome. Suggested for use with single end reads data. 2. Genome annotation file DegNorm needs a .gtf file to determine the transcript for computing the per-gene coverage curves, which span a concatenation of the coding regions only (introns are ignored). It is assumed your .gtf file abides by the standard conventions . Argument Required? Meaning -g , --genome-annotation Yes .gtf file for relevant genome. Using a warm start directory Loading multiple .bam files, parsing a .gtf files, and computing per-gene cross-sample coverage matrices and read counts, can take some time, but this is a one-time preprocessing cost given a specific set of RNA-Seq experiments. If you run the degnorm pipeline once, you can leverage the stored coverage, read counts, and parsed transcript data from an existing DegNorm output directory to start a a new DegNorm run where all of the preprocessing is completed ahead of time. When using --warm-start-dir you do not need to supply a .gtf file. Argument Required? Meaning --warm-start-dir No A directory holding the contents of a successful previous degnorm pipeline run. When specified, there is no need to supply a .gtf file. Runtime and algorithmic parameters Argument Required? Meaning -o , --output-dir No Defaults to the current working directory. Use to specify location where pipeline output directory will be written. --plot-genes No Names of genes for which to render coverage plots. Sequence of explictly stated gene names or a .txt file containing one gene name per line. -d , --downsample-rate No EXPERIMENTAL. Integer downsampling rate. Systematic samples of a coverage matrix are used to speed up NMF iterations. --nmf-iter No Number of iterations per NMF-OA approximation. The higher the more accurate the approximation, but the more costly in terms of time. --iter No Number of whole DegNorm iterations. Default is 5. --minimax-coverage No Minimum cross-sample maximum coverage for a gene before it is included in the DegNorm pipeline. Can be used to exclude relatively low-coverage genes. -s , --skip-baseline-selection No EXPERIMENTAL. Flag to skip baseline selection, will greatly speed up DegNorm iterations. -c , --cpu No Integer number of threads. The more the better. Example usage Run degnorm with an input directory (containing multiple .bam files) with 20 threads, use 5 DegNorm iterations and 50 NMF iterations per gene per NMF iteration. Route output to a directory besides the current working directory. degnorm --bam-dir degnorm_data/GBM \\ -g human.gtf \\ -c 20 \\ --nmf-iter 50 \\ -o degnorm_output This is equivalent to simply enumerating the .bam files individually.

See the posthoc analysis documentation for helper functions to access coverage data. In addition to per-gene coverage matrices, degnorm will produce raw and degradation-adjusted read counts, a matrix of degradation index scores, a matrix describing which genes were sent through the baseline selection procedure and when, along with various summary graphics and a pipeline summary report.

In addition to per-gene coverage matrices, degnorm will produce raw and degradation-adjusted read counts, a matrix of degradation index scores, a matrix describing which genes were sent through the baseline selection procedure and when, along with various summary graphics and a pipeline summary report.
