DegNorm, short for deg radation norm alization, is a bioinformatics pipeline designed to correct for bias due to the heterogeneous patterns of transcript degradation in RNA-seq data. DegNorm helps improve the accuracy of the differential expression analysis by accounting for this degradation. We've supplied a degnorm command line interface and Python package to run this pipeline from start (beginning with .bam files) to finish. In practice, RNA samples are often more-or-less degraded, and the degradation severity is not only sample-specific, but gene-specific as well. It is known that longer genes tend to degrade faster than shorter ones. As such, commonplace global degradation normalization approaches that impose a single normalization factor on all genes within a sample can be ineffective in correcting for RNA degradation bias. DegNorm is a data-driven approach for RNA-Seq normalization resulting in the adjusted read count matrix. This adjustment applies to each gene within each sample, accounting for sample- and gene-specific degradation bias while simultaneously controlling for the sequencing depth. The algorithm at the center of DegNorm is the rank-one over-approximation of a gene's coverage score matrix, which is comprised of the different samples' coverage score curves along the transcript for each gene. For each gene, DegNorm estimates (1) an envelope function representing the ideal shape of the gene's coverage curve when no degradation is present, and (2) scale factors for each sample (for said gene) that indicates the relative abundance of the gene within the sample. Define a (gene, sample) degradation index score (DI score) as the area between the scaled envelope function and the actual coverage score function, divided by the area under the scaled envelope function, for each gene within each sample. The DI score can be used to account for read count loss due to degradation. How does the pipeline work? The DegNorm pipeline is comprised of the following steps Load in sorted .bam files . DegNorm also requires bam index (.bai) files - these can be created for you if samtools is in your $PATH . DegNorm will determine whether the RNA-Seq experiment was obtained from a paired read or single read platform. Parse a genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff). We determine the start and end positions of all exons comprising each gene in each chromosome. Each gene's total transcript is constructed by concatenating all annotated exons sequentially. Exons shared by multiple genes are removed from the total transcript. The total number of genes is referred to as n . Compute gene coverage matrices and read counts . DegNorm does not use standard coverage tools (e.g. geneomecov ), as they do not take into account the overlap of paired-end reads when computing coverage. DegNorm reads the CIGAR score and determines whether two paired reads overlap, and the overlapping region is only counted once in the coverage score calculation. For read counting, a read is is only attributed to a particular gene if it is determined that the read lies fully within just one single gene's transcript. There are n genes and p experiments, so the read count matrix has dimensions (n, p) . Fit a non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation model, as outlined in the central DegNorm paper. Save results and data to an output directory that includes the following: original read counts degradation-adjusted read counts gene-/sample-specific degradation index scores raw coverage matrices stored in .pkl files, one file per chromosome DegNorm-normalized coverage matrices, also stored in .pkl files, one file per chromosome DegNorm summary report","title":"Home"},{"location":"#degnorm-home","text":"Visit the DegNorm source code at GitHub Read the 2019 DegNorm paper in Genome Biology: DegNorm: normalization of generalized transcript degradation improves accuracy in RNA-seq analysis Check out the DegNorm R package","title":"DegNorm Home"},{"location":"#what-is-degnorm","text":"DegNorm, short for deg radation norm alization, is a bioinformatics pipeline designed to correct for bias due to the heterogeneous patterns of transcript degradation in RNA-seq data.

You can access it through the degnorm command and the MPI-enabled distributed version is degnorm_mpi . Inputs You only need two types of files to supply degnorm - .bam files (0-indexed) and a .gtf file (1-indexed) if you have samtools in your $PATH . If you do not have samtools , you will also need bam index files to accompany your .bam files. 1. (Optional) index files (.bai) Before running DegNorm, you will need to sort (and optionally, index) them with samtools sort . This command just re-orders reads by chromosome and starting index, so that they can be more useful to DegNorm later on. To sort an alignment file, suppose it's called S1.bam , you can sort it with the following command: # sort alignment files (necessary for indexing them) samtools sort S1.bam -o S1_sorted.bam DegNorm requires sorted .bam files because it really needs bam index files . If you don't create them first, DegNorm will run samtools index to create an index file for each input alignment file: # create alignment index files samtools index S1_sorted.bam S1_sorted.bai Within the .bam files reads must be 0-indexed . 2. Paired or single-end aligned and sorted reads (.bam) At least two alignment files (.bam) must be specified, as inter-sample degradation normalization cannot happen on a standalone RNA-Seq sample. We refer to the total number of samples as p . If .bai files are not submitted, degnorm will look for .bai files named after the .bam files only with the \".bai\" extension. If no such file is found, degnorm will attempt to build one with the samtools index command. This will only work if the .bam files are sorted. Instead of specifying individual .bam and .bai files, you can just specify --bam-dir , a path to a directory holding the relevant .bam and .bai files. With --bam-dir , it is assumed that the .bai files are named according to the .bam files, only with the \".bai\" extension. You can supply paired reads files or single end reads files . Argument Required? Meaning --bam-files If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bam files --bai-files If samtools is not in the $PATH and neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bai files. If specified, they must be in the order corresponding to --bam-files . --bam-dir If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-files are specified Directory containing .bam and .bai files for a pipeline run. It is assumed the .bai files have the same name as the .bam files, just with a different extension. 3. Genome annotation file (.gtf) DegNorm needs a .gtf file in order to construct the total transcript and compute all per-gene coverage score curves. It is assumed that the positions in the .gtf file are 1-indexed and that the file abides by the standard .gtf conventions . Argument Required? Meaning -g , --genome-annotation Yes .gtf file for relevant genome. Start and end positions with the .gtf file must be 1-indexed . Additionally, the .gtf file must have the 9 standard .gtf fields. Here is an example of a .gtf file we use to test degnorm : seqname source feature start end score strand frame attribute chr1 unknown exon 323892 324060 . + . gene_id \"LOC100133331\"; gene_name \"LOC100133331\"; transcript_id \"NR_028327_1\"; tss_id \"TSS14025\"; chr1 unknown exon 324288 324345 . + . gene_id \"LOC100133331\"; gene_name \"LOC100133331\"; transcript_id \"NR_028327_1\"; tss_id \"TSS14025\"; chr1 unknown exon 324439 326938 . + . gene_id \"LOC100133331\"; gene_name \"LOC100133331\"; transcript_id \"NR_028327_1\"; tss_id \"TSS14025\"; Specifically, the attribute field must, at a minimum, contain either a gene_name or gene_id attribute so that we can pair exons to uniquely-identified genes. Also, .gtf records will be filtered down to those whose feature = \"exon\". Using a warm start directory Loading multiple .bam files, parsing a .gtf file, and computing per-gene cross-sample coverage matrices and read counts, can take some time, but this is a one-time preprocessing cost given a specific set of RNA-Seq samples. If you run the degnorm pipeline once, you can leverage the stored coverage, read counts, and parsed transcript data from an existing DegNorm output directory to start a a new DegNorm run where all of the preprocessing is completed ahead of time. When using --warm-start-dir you do not need to supply a .gtf file. Argument Required? Meaning --warm-start-dir No A directory holding the contents of a successful previous degnorm pipeline run. When specified, there is no need to supply a .gtf file. Runtime and algorithmic parameters Argument Required? Meaning -o , --output-dir No Output directory. Default is current working directory. Directory will be created if it doesn't currently. If not supplied or if directory already exists, DegNorm creates a new output directory degnorm_mmddYYYY_HHMMSS . --plot-genes No Names of genes for which to render coverage plots. Sequence of explictly stated gene names or a .txt file containing one gene name per line. -d , --downsample-rate No Integer downsampling rate. Systematic samples of a coverage matrix are used to speed up NMF iterations. --nmf-iter No Number of iterations per NMF-OA approximation. The higher the more accurate the approximation, but the more costly in terms of time. --iter No Number of whole DegNorm iterations. Default is 5. --minimax-coverage No Minimum cross-sample maximum coverage for a gene before it is included in the DegNorm pipeline. Can be used to exclude relatively low-coverage genes. -s , --skip-baseline-selection No Flag to skip baseline selection, will greatly speed up DegNorm iterations. --non-unique-alignments No Flag, allow non-uniquely mapped reads. Otherwise, DegNorm only keeps reads with NH (number of hits) == 1 (default behavior). -p , --proc-per-node No Integer number of processes to spawn per compute node. The more the better. Defaults to a lonely 1. Example usage Required: sorting, indexing alignment files Remember - prior to running degnorm , you must sort your aligned reads and create index files (.bai files). Suppose we have set of .bam files in our current working directory that we would like to send through DegNorm, the following commands will sort the .bam files and create .bai files, all with samtools : # sort and index alignment files in current working directory. for FILE in ./*.bam do echo 'sorting '$FILE samtools sort $FILE -o ${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bam' echo 'indexing '${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bam' samtools index ${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bam' ${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bai' done Launching a full degnorm run \"the verbose way\" Next, after the alignment files have been sorted (and optionally indexed), let's run degnorm \"the verbose way\" by enumerating each .bam and .bai file individually. Suppose we have two sorted alignment files, S1_sorted.bam and S2_sorted.bam , and that we want to save the results of the pipeline to a new directory called degnorm_output . # run degnorm on two samples on 20 cores, using 100 NMF iterations per gene degnorm --bam-files S1_sorted.bam S2_sorted.bam \\ --bai-files S1_sorted.bai S2_sorted.bai \\ -g human.gtf \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output If we did not specify any --bai-files , then DegNorm would automatically search for files \"S1_sorted.bai\" and \"S2_sorted.bai\" because they're named after the alignment files, \"S1_sorted.bam\" and \"S2_sorted.bam.\" If those index files cannot be found, they will be created in the same directory containing the input .bam files, only if samtools is in your $PATH . Launching a full degnorm run \"the easy way\" It's probably just easier to supply degnorm with an input data directory containing all of our .bam files, instead of each .bam file individually. Suppose that data directory is located at degnorm_data/GBM . Let's also use 5 DegNorm iterations, 50 NMF iterations per gene per NMF iteration, and route output to a directory besides the current working directory. degnorm --bam-dir degnorm_data/GBM \\ -g human.gtf \\ -p 20 \\ --nmf-iter 50 \\ -o degnorm_output Using a warm start directory After one pipeline run, we could start degnorm from the output directory resulting from the first run - this directory is known as the \"warm start\" directory. This time, let's exclude genes with a maximum coverage (across all samples) less than 20, and run DegNorm with only 3 iterations. In this example, the DegNorm_102118_081045 warm start directory would have been generated from a prior DegNorm run. degnorm --warm-start-dir degnorm_output/DegNorm_102118_081045 \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output \\ --minimax-coverage 20 \\ --iter 3 Launching distributed runs with MPI Let's speed this up by distributing DegNorm's workload over multiple servers with degnorm_mpi ! If the mpi4py python package has been installed (meaning that MPICH is available in your compute environment). You can still specify the number of cores to use on each node with -p . # run degnorm_mpi using 4 nodes (\"-n 4\") mpiexec -n 4 degnorm_mpi \\ --warm-start-dir degnorm_output/DegNorm_GBM_102018 \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output \\ --minimax-coverage 20 --nmf-iter 100 The functionality of degnorm_mpi is the same as the single-node degnorm command, so you can continue using warm start directories just like you could with degnorm . If you are unfamiliar with MPI, you may find Wes Kendall's tutorials very enlightening. Example job submission script Below is an example of a shell script containing the contents of a job you might submit to a job manager (e.g. MOAB). Note that additional steps would be required to convert this script into a SLURM job submission script. Output Raw and estimated coverage data are stored in separate .pkl files, one file per chromosome. See the posthoc analysis documentation for helper functions to access coverage data. A gene that has 100% missing coverage (no coverage found in any RNA-seq sample) will not be run through DegNorm for numerical stability purposes and will therefore not have a coverage matrix stored in any of the .pkl files. In addition to per-gene coverage matrices, degnorm will produce raw and degradation-adjusted read counts, a matrix of degradation index scores, a matrix describing which genes were sent through the baseline selection procedure and when, along with various summary graphics and a pipeline summary report. The report will render as an .html file, but if you have pandoc installed it will be converted to a .pdf. \u251c\u2500\u2500 degnorm.log \u251c\u2500\u2500 degradation_index_scores.csv \u251c\u2500\u2500 ran_baseline_selection.csv # matrix of Booleans: which genes go thru baseline selection \u251c\u2500\u2500 gene_exon_metadata.csv # chromosome, gene, exon relationship data \u251c\u2500\u2500 read_counts.csv # raw read counts \u251c\u2500\u2500 adjusted_read_counts.csv # degradation normalized read counts \u251c\u2500\u2500 chr1 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 GAPDH_coverage.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 <more coverage plots> \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 coverage_matrices_chr1.pkl # (gene, raw coverage matrix) pairs in serialized python dictionary. \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 estimated_coverage_matrices_chr1.pkl # (gene, estimated coverage matrix) pairs in serialized python dictionary. \u251c\u2500\u2500 chr2 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 coverage_matrices_chr2.pkl \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 estimated_coverage_matrices_chr2.pkl \u251c\u2500\u2500 chr3 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 coverage_matrices_chr3.pkl \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 estimated_coverage_matrices_chr3.pkl \u251c\u2500\u2500 chr4 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 GAPDH_coverage.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 coverage_matrices_chr4.pkl \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 estimated_coverage_matrices_chr4.pkl \u251c\u2500\u2500 <more chromosome directories> \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 <more raw coverage matrix .pkl files> \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 <more estimated coverage matrix .pkl files> \u2514\u2500\u2500 report \u251c\u2500\u2500 degnorm_summary.pdf # (or .html if pandoc not available) \u251c\u2500\u2500 di_boxplots.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 di_correlation.png \u2514\u2500\u2500 di_heatmap.png","title":"Running DegNorm"},{"location":"howtos/run_the_pipeline/#running-degnorm","text":"DegNorm is a command line interface (CLI) tool.

With MPI, preprocessing and coverage matrix approximations will scale by the number of available compute nodes. MPI also allows you to best exploit the embarrassingly parallel nature of the DegNorm workload. See the degnorm_mpi example in the usage docs . Downsampling coverage matrices The backbone of the DegNorm normalization pipeline is the non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation (NMFOA) algorithm. NMFOA is a computationally expensive algorithm, requiring --nmf-iter -many singular value decompositions of the coverage matrix. The SVD is O(n^3) in terms of flop count (according to Trefethen and Bau), so genes with smaller coverage matrices will naturally run through NMFOA faster than larger ones. In an effort to trim down the coverage matrices, the --downsample-rate argument in degnorm allows you to use a systematic sample for each gene's coverage matrix in lieu of the larger original ones. The --downsample-rate is just the integer-valued \"take-every\" step size, so that the original coverage matrix is reduced by a factor of 1 / (downsample rate). At a modest downsampling rate, the overall shape of the coverage curves should still be recognizable. Obviously, the higher the downsampling rate, the faster the DegNorm iterations will complete, because DegNorm executes SVD approximations on smaller and smaller gene coverage matrices. The figure below illustrates the time savings at various downsampling rates from the 9-sample gliablastoma (GBM) cell line study data set: Impact We recreated the DE analysis using the GBM data as well as the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) AA vs. AB data at various downsampling rates. In comparison to the non-downsampled results (as in, 1/1 downsampling), we see that moderate downsampling - e.g. a rate of 1/20 - does not substantially impact DE analysis and still allow for DegNorm retains its edge over existing RNA-Seq normalization methods, while offering 50%+ DegNorm iteration time savings. GBM RIN 10 vs. RIN 4 ECDF curve comparison GBM RIN 6 vs. RIN 4 ECDF curve comparison SEQC AA vs AB ROC curve comparison To run DegNorm with downsampling, add -d <take every> (full option --downsample-rate <take every> ) where take every is the integer step size for the systematic sample. Note that genes with total concatenated exon length less than the downsample rate will not be included in the DegNorm pipeline. Skipping baseline selection The most expensive part of the DegNorm normalization algorithm is in finding a \"baseline\" region of non-degraded coverage across all samples, a process referred to as baseline selection . In the event that that region is small, the approximation of a single gene's coverage curves may require over a thousand SVDs. Skipping baseline selection offers the largest speedup , more than any level of downsampling, but likely with a more heavy impact on DegNorm's performance. We cannot wholly endorse skipping baseline selection, but for those who are seeking ballpark DegNorm results in an hour or two, this option may be for you. Impact The impact of skipping baseline selection is experiment-specific, and is likely due to the nature and extent of RNA degradation present in the samples. As is shown in the figure below, the skipping baseline selection negatively impacts the SEQC AA/AB DE ROC curve. At the same time, DegNorm still retains its advantage over the existing normalization methods with respect to GBM p-value ECDF curves, even while skipping baseline selection. Run DegNorm without baseline selection at your own risk by adding the --skip-baseline-selection flag at the command line.","title":"Speed enhancements"},{"location":"howtos/speedups/#degnorm-speed-enhancements","text":"","title":"DegNorm speed enhancements"},{"location":"howtos/speedups/#distributed-pipeline-runs-with-degnorm_mpi","text":"Use degnorm_mpi to distribute DegNorm over parallel compute nodes via MPI, the Message Passing Interface standard .

Obviously, the higher the downsampling rate, the faster the DegNorm iterations will complete, because DegNorm executes SVD approximations on smaller and smaller gene coverage matrices. The figure below illustrates the time savings at various downsampling rates from the 9-sample gliablastoma (GBM) cell line study data set:","title":"Downsampling coverage matrices"},{"location":"howtos/speedups/#impact","text":"We recreated the DE analysis using the GBM data as well as the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) AA vs. AB data at various downsampling rates. In comparison to the non-downsampled results (as in, 1/1 downsampling), we see that moderate downsampling - e.g. a rate of 1/20 - does not substantially impact DE analysis and still allow for DegNorm retains its edge over existing RNA-Seq normalization methods, while offering 50%+ DegNorm iteration time savings.

Note that genes with total concatenated exon length less than the downsample rate will not be included in the DegNorm pipeline.","title":"Impact"},{"location":"howtos/speedups/#skipping-baseline-selection","text":"The most expensive part of the DegNorm normalization algorithm is in finding a \"baseline\" region of non-degraded coverage across all samples, a process referred to as baseline selection . In the event that that region is small, the approximation of a single gene's coverage curves may require over a thousand SVDs. Skipping baseline selection offers the largest speedup , more than any level of downsampling, but likely with a more heavy impact on DegNorm's performance. We cannot wholly endorse skipping baseline selection, but for those who are seeking ballpark DegNorm results in an hour or two, this option may be for you.","title":"Skipping baseline selection"},{"location":"howtos/speedups/#impact_1","text":"The impact of skipping baseline selection is experiment-specific, and is likely due to the nature and extent of RNA degradation present in the samples. As is shown in the figure below, the skipping baseline selection negatively impacts the SEQC AA/AB DE ROC curve. At the same time, DegNorm still retains its advantage over the existing normalization methods with respect to GBM p-value ECDF curves, even while skipping baseline selection. Run DegNorm without baseline selection at your own risk by adding the --skip-baseline-selection flag at the command line.","title":"Impact"}]}
