Most existing global degradation normalization approaches (global in the sense of being across-genes, across-samples) can be ineffective in correcting RNA degradation bias. A key result from running DegNorm is the adjustment of read counts for transcript degradation heterogeneity on a per-gene, per-sample basis while simultaneously controlling for sequencing depth. Underlying the DegNorm pipeline is the rank-one over-approximation of a gene's coverage matrix , or, the matrix of per-sample, per-nucleotide-aligned reads. For each gene DegNorm will estimate an envelope function and a scale factor for each sample. Samples whose true coverage curve lies well below their estimated coverage curve are considered degraded, and are assigned a degradation index score (or, DI score) of between 0 and 1. Batch effects can be captured by comparing the distribution of DI scores between samples. The DegNorm pipeline is comprised of the following steps Load in RNA-Seq .sam files . If passed .bam files, DegNorm will attempt to convert them to .sam files if you have samtools installed. It will also determine whether the RNA-Seq experiment was obtained from a paired read or single read platform. Parse a genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff). DegNorm determines the relative start and end positions of each gene transcript and each exon comprising each gene on each chromosome. Genes occurring on multiple chromosomes and exons occurring on multiple genes are removed. The total number of genes is referred to as n . Compute the chromosome-wide coverage for each experiment. DegNorm does not use standard coverage tools (e.g. geneomecov ) that do not take into account paired read overlap when computing coverage - here, every match segment of a read's CIGAR score augments nucleotide coverage. For each experiment, for each chromosome, we save coverage in a compressed Numpy array. There are p experiments. Assess per-gene read counts by counting the number of paired reads falling entirely within the start and end position of every gene. The read count matrix is a n x p matrix. Break up chromosome coverage matrices into per-gene coverage matrices . Gene matrices are saved to pickle file (a serialized data format for Python), one .pkl file per chromosome. Fit a non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation model, as outlined in the central DegNorm paper. Save adjusted read counts, gene- and experiment-specific degradation index scores , normalized coverage matrices, and coverage visualizations to an output directory.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#degnorm-home","text":"DegNorm source code on GitHub","title":"DegNorm Home"},{"location":"#overview","text":"DegNorm, short for deg radation norm alization is a genomics pipeline that addresses trascript degradation on a (gene, sample)-specific level that can otherwise substantially bias the results of an RNA-Seq analysis.

You can access it through the degnorm command. Inputs You only need two types of files to supply degnorm 1. (Paired or single eng) aligned reads data At least two aligned reads files must be supplied, as inter-sample degradation normalization can't happen on a standalone RNA-Seq expermient. Use p to refer to the total number of experiments. If you have samtools installed, feel free to provide .bam files - DegNorm will convert them to their text equivalent via samtools view -h -o {.sam} {.bam} . It is assumed your .sam files abide by the conventions . You can supply paired reads files or single end reads files . Argument Required? Meaning -i , --input-files Only if --input-dir not supplied Individual .sam or .bam files. Any .bam files will be converted to .sam if samtools is available. --input-dir Only if input files not supplied A directory containing a set of .sam files. In this case, .bam files will be ignored. -u , --unique-alignments optional flag If specified, tells DegNorm to remove reads aligned to more than one area of the genome. Suggested for use with single end reads data. 2. Genome annotation file DegNorm needs a .gtf file to determine the transcript for computing the per-gene coverage curves, which span a concatenation of the coding regions only (introns are ignored). It is assumed your .gtf file abides by the conventions Argument Required? Meaning -g , --genome-annotation Yes .gtf file for relevant genome. Using a \"warm start\" directory Loading multiple .sam files, parsing a .gtf files, and computing per-gene cross-sample coverage matrices and read counts, can take some time, but there is really no need to run this process more than once for a specific set of RNA-Seq experiments. If you run the degnorm pipeline once, you can leverage the stored coverage, read counts, and parsed transcript data from an existing DegNorm output directory to start a a new DegNorm run where all of the data preprocessing is already completed. When using --warm-start-dir you do not need to supply a .gtf file. Argument Required? Meaning --warm-start-dir No A directory holding the contents of a successful previous degnorm pipeline run. When specified, there is no need to supply a .gtf file. Runtime and algorithmic parameters Argument Required? Meaning -o , --output-dir No Defaults to the current working directory.

Sequence of explictly stated gene names or a .txt file containing one gene name per line. -d , --downsample-rate No EXPERIMENTAL. Integer downsampling rate. Systematic samples of a coverage matrix are used to speed up NMF iterations. --nmf-iter No Number of iterations per NMF-OA approximation. The higher the more accurate the approximation, but the more costly in terms of time. --iter No Number of whole DegNorm iterations. Default is 5. --minimax-coverage No Minimum cross-sample maximum coverage for a gene before it is included in the DegNorm pipeline.

Flag to skip baseline selection, will greatly speed up DegNorm iterations. -c , --cpu No Integer number of threads. The more the better.
