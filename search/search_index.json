DegNorm, short for deg radation norm alization, is a bioinformatics pipeline designed to correct for bias due to the heterogeneous patterns of transcript degradation in RNA-seq data. DegNorm helps improve the accuracy of the differential expression analysis by accounting for this degradation. In practice, RNA samples are often more-or-less degraded, and the degradation severity is not only sample-specific, but gene-specific as well. It is known that longer genes tend to degrade faster than shorter ones. As such, commonplace global degradation normalization approaches that impose a single normalization factor on all genes within a sample can be ineffective in correcting for RNA degradation bias. DegNorm is a data-driven approach for RNA-Seq normalization resulting in the adjusted read count matrix. This adjustment applies to each gene within each sample, accounting for sample- and gene-specific degradation bias while simultaneously controlling for the sequencing depth. The algorithm at the center of DegNorm is the rank-one over-approximation of a gene's coverage score matrix, which is comprised of the different samples' coverage score curves along the transcript for each gene. For each gene, DegNorm estimates (1) an envelope function representing the ideal shape of the gene's coverage curve when no degradation is present, and (2) scale factors for each sample (for said gene) that indicates the relative abundance of the gene within the sample. Define a (gene, sample) degradation index score (DI score) as the area between the scaled envelope function and the actual coverage score function, divided by the area under the scaled envelope function, for each gene within each sample. The DI score can be used to account for read count loss due to degradation. How does the pipeline work? The DegNorm pipeline is comprised of the following steps Load in sorted .bam files . DegNorm also requires bam index (.bai) files - these can be created for you if samtools is in your $PATH . DegNorm will determine whether the RNA-Seq experiment was obtained from a paired read or single read platform. Parse a genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff). We determine the start and end positions of all exons comprising each gene in each chromosome. Each gene's total transcript is constructed by concatenating all annotated exons sequentially. Exons shared by multiple genes are removed from the total transcript. The total number of genes is referred to as n . Compute gene coverage matrices and read counts . DegNorm does not use standard coverage tools (e.g. geneomecov ), as they do not take into account the overlap of paired-end reads when computing coverage. DegNorm reads the CIGAR score and determines whether two paired reads overlap, and the overlapping region is only counted once in the coverage score calculation. For read counting, a read is is only attributed to a particular gene if it is determined that the read lies fully within just one single gene's transcript. There are n genes and p experiments, so the read count matrix has dimensions (n, p) . Fit a non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation model, as outlined in the central DegNorm paper.

You can access it through the degnorm command and the MPI-enabled distributed version is degnorm_mpi . Inputs You only need two types of files to supply degnorm - .bam files (0-indexed) and a .gtf file (1-indexed) if you have samtools in your $PATH . If you do not have samtools , you will also need bam index files to accompany your .bam files. 1. Align and sort aligned reads Before running DegNorm, you will need to sort (and optionally, index) them with samtools sort . This command just re-orders reads by chromosome and starting index, so that they can be more useful to DegNorm later on. To sort an alignment file, suppose it's called S1.bam , you can sort it with the following command: # sort alignment files (necessary for indexing them) samtools sort S1.bam -o S1_sorted.bam DegNorm requires sorted .bam files because it really needs bam index files . If you don't create them first, DegNorm will run samtools index to create an index file for each input alignment file: # create alignment index files samtools index S1_sorted.bam S1_sorted.bai Within the .bam files reads are assumed 0-indexed . 2. (Paired or single end) aligned and sorted reads data At least two alignment files (.bam) must be specified, as inter-sample degradation normalization cannot happen on a standalone RNA-Seq sample. Use p to refer to the total number of samples. If .bai files are not submitted, degnorm will look for .bai files named after the .bam files only with the \".bai\" extension. If no such file is found, degnorm will attempt to build one with the samtools index command. This will only work if the .bam files are sorted. Instead of specifying individual .bam and .bai files, you can just specify --bam-dir , a path to a directory holding the relevant .bam and .bai files. With --bam-dir , it is assumed that the .bai files are named according to the .bam files, only with the \".bai\" extension. You can supply paired reads files or single end reads files . Argument Required? Meaning --bam-files If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bam files --bai-files If samtools is not in the $PATH and neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bai files. If specified, they must be in the order corresponding to --bam-files . --bam-dir If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-files are specified Directory containing .bam and .bai files for a pipeline run. It is assumed the .bai files have the same name as the .bam files, just with a different extension. -u , --unique-alignments optional flag If specified, tells degnorm to remove reads aligned to more than one location on the genome. Suggested for use with single end reads data. 3. Genome annotation file DegNorm needs a .gtf file in order to construct the total transcript and compute all per-gene coverage score curves. It is assumed that the positions in the .gtf file are 1-index and that the file abides by the standard .gtf conventions . Argument Required? Meaning -g , --genome-annotation Yes .gtf file for relevant genome. Using a warm start directory Loading multiple .bam files, parsing a .gtf file, and computing per-gene cross-sample coverage matrices and read counts, can take some time, but this is a one-time preprocessing cost given a specific set of RNA-Seq samples. If you run the degnorm pipeline once, you can leverage the stored coverage, read counts, and parsed transcript data from an existing DegNorm output directory to start a a new DegNorm run where all of the preprocessing is completed ahead of time. When using --warm-start-dir you do not need to supply a .gtf file. Argument Required? Meaning --warm-start-dir No A directory holding the contents of a successful previous degnorm pipeline run. When specified, there is no need to supply a .gtf file. Runtime and algorithmic parameters Argument Required? Meaning -o , --output-dir No Defaults to the current working directory. Use to specify location where pipeline output directory will be written. --plot-genes No Names of genes for which to render coverage plots. Sequence of explictly stated gene names or a .txt file containing one gene name per line. -d , --downsample-rate No Integer downsampling rate. Systematic samples of a coverage matrix are used to speed up NMF iterations. --nmf-iter No Number of iterations per NMF-OA approximation. The higher the more accurate the approximation, but the more costly in terms of time. --iter No Number of whole DegNorm iterations. Default is 5. --minimax-coverage No Minimum cross-sample maximum coverage for a gene before it is included in the DegNorm pipeline. Can be used to exclude relatively low-coverage genes. -s , --skip-baseline-selection No Flag to skip baseline selection, will greatly speed up DegNorm iterations. --non-unique-alignments No Flag, allow non-uniquely mapped reads. Otherwise, DegNorm only keeps reads with NH (number of hits) == 1 (default behavior). -p , --proc-per-node No Integer number of processes to spawn per compute node. The more the better. Example usage Required: sorting, indexing alignment files Remember - prior to running degnorm , you must sort your aligned reads and create index files (.bai files). Suppose we have set of .bam files in our current working directory that we would like to send through DegNorm, the following commands will sort the .bam files and create .bai files, all with samtools : # sort and index alignment files in current working directory. for FILE in ./*.bam do echo 'sorting '$FILE samtools sort $FILE -o ${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bam' echo 'indexing '${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bam' samtools index ${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bam' ${FILE/.bam/}'_sorted.bai' done Launching a full degnorm run \"the verbose way\" Next, after the alignment files have been sorted (and optionally indexed), let's run degnorm \"the verbose way\" by enumerating each .bam and .bai file individually. Suppose we have two sorted alignment files, S1_sorted.bam and S2_sorted.bam . # run degnorm on two samples on 20 cores, using 100 NMF iterations per gene degnorm --bam-files S1_sorted.bam S2_sorted.bam \\ --bai-files S1_sorted.bai S2_sorted.bai \\ -g human.gtf \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output If we did not specify any --bai-files , then DegNorm would automatically search for files \"S1_sorted.bai\" and \"S2_sorted.bai\" because they're named after the alignment files, \"S1_sorted.bam\" and \"S2_sorted.bam.\" If those index files cannot be found, they will be created in the same directory containing the input .bam files, only if samtools is in your $PATH . Launching a full degnorm run \"the easy way\" It's probably just easier to supply degnorm with an input directory containing all of our .bam files, instead of each .bam file individually. Suppose that data directory is located at degnorm_data/GBM . Let's also use 5 DegNorm iterations, 50 NMF iterations per gene per NMF iteration, and route output to a directory besides the current working directory. degnorm --bam-dir degnorm_data/GBM \\ -g human.gtf \\ -p 20 \\ --nmf-iter 50 \\ -o degnorm_output Using a warm start directory After one pipeline run, we could start degnorm from the output directory resulting from the first run - this directory is known as the \"warm start\" directory. This time, let's exclude genes with a maximum coverage (across all samples) less than 20, and run DegNorm with only 3 iterations. In this example, DegNorm_102118_081045 was generated automatically from one of the prior DegNorm runs. degnorm --warm-start-dir degnorm_output/DegNorm_102118_081045 \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output \\ --minimax-coverage 20 \\ --iter 3 Launching distributed runs with MPI Let's speed this up by distributing DegNorm's workload over multiple servers with degnorm_mpi ! If the mpi4py python package has been installed (meaning that MPICH is available in your compute environment). You can still specify the number of cores to use on each node with -p . # run degnorm_mpi using 4 nodes (\"-n 4\") mpiexec -n 4 degnorm_mpi \\ --warm-start-dir degnorm_output/DegNorm_GBM_102018 \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output \\ --minimax-coverage 20 --nmf-iter 100 The functionality of degnorm_mpi is the same as the single-node degnorm , so you can continue using warm start directories just like you could with degnorm . If you are unfamiliar with MPI, a great Output Raw and estimated coverage data are stored in separate .pkl files, one file per chromosome.

Downsampling coverage matrices The backbone of the DegNorm normalization pipeline is the non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation (NMFOA) algorithm. NMFOA is a computationally expensive algorithm, requiring --nmf-iter -many singular value decompositions of the coverage matrix.
