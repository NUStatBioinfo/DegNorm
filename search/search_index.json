DegNorm, short for deg radation norm alization, is a bioinformatics pipeline designed to correct for bias due to the heterogeneous patterns of transcript degradation in RNA-seq data. DegNorm helps improve the accuracy of the differential expression analysis by accounting for this degradation. In practice, RNA samples are often more-or-less degraded, and the degradation severity is not only sample-specific, but gene-specific as well. It is known that longer genes tend to degrade faster than shorter ones. As such, commonplace global degradation normalization approaches that impose a single normalization factor on all genes within a sample can be ineffective in correcting for RNA degradation bias. DegNorm is a data-driven approach for RNA-Seq normalization resulting in the adjusted read count matrix. This adjustment applies to each gene within each sample, accounting for sample- and gene-specific degradation bias while simultaneously controlling for the sequencing depth. The algorithm at the center of DegNorm is the rank-one over-approximation of a gene's coverage score matrix, which is comprised of the different samples' coverage score curves along the transcript for each gene. For each gene, DegNorm estimates (1) an envelope function representing the ideal shape of the gene's coverage curve when no degradation is present, and (2) scale factors for each sample (for said gene) that indicates the relative abundance of the gene within the sample. Define a (gene, sample) degradation index score (DI score) as the area between the scaled envelope function and the actual coverage score function, divided by the area under the scaled envelope function, for each gene within each sample. The DI score can be used to account for read count loss due to degradation. How does the pipeline work? The DegNorm pipeline is comprised of the following steps Load in sorted .bam files . DegNorm also requires bam index (.bai) files - these can be created for you if samtools is in your $PATH . DegNorm will determine whether the RNA-Seq experiment was obtained from a paired read or single read platform. Parse a genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff). We determine the start and end positions of all exons comprising each gene in each chromosome. Each gene's total transcript is constructed by concatenating all annotated exons sequentially. Exons shared by multiple genes are removed from the total transcript. The total number of genes is referred to as n . Compute gene coverage matrices . DegNorm does not use standard coverage tools (e.g. geneomecov ), as they do not take into account the overlap of paired-end reads when computing coverage. DegNorm reads the CIGAR score and determines whether two paired reads overlap. The overlapped region is only counted once in the coverage score calculation. There are p experiments. Assess per-gene read counts by counting the number of pairs of reads (in the paired data) or number of reads (single-end) falling entirely within the start and end position of every gene. The read count matrix has dimensions (n, p) . Fit a non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation model, as outlined in the central DegNorm paper.

You can access it through the degnorm command and the MPI-enabled distributed version is degnorm_mpi . Inputs You only need two types of files to supply degnorm : .bam (and their corresponding .bai files - bam index files ), and a .gtf file. If you have samtools in your $PATH , .bai files can be created for you automatically, if they are not supplied. 1. (Paired or single end) aligned and sorted reads data At least two alignment files (.bam) must be specified, as inter-sample degradation normalization cannot happen on a standalone RNA-Seq sample. Use p to refer to the total number of samples. It is assumed your .bam files are sorted by leftmost start coordinate (i.e. with samtools sort ), contain a header, and abide by the conventions . If .bai files are not submitted, degnorm will look for .bai files named after the .bam files only with the \".bai\" extension. If no such file is found, degnorm will attempt to build one with the samtools index command. This will only work if the .bam files are sorted. Instead of specifying individual .bam and .bai files, you can just specify --bam-dir , a path to a directory holding the relevant .bam and .bai files. With --bam-dir , it is assumed that the .bai files are named according to the .bam files, only with the \".bai\" extension. You can supply paired reads files or single end reads files . Argument Required? Meaning --bam-files If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bam files --bai-files If samtools is not in the $PATH and neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-dir are specified Set of individual .bai files. If specified, they must be in the order corresponding to --bam-files . --bam-dir If neither --warm-start-dir nor --bam-files are specified Directory containing .bam and .bai files for a pipeline run. It is assumed the .bai files have the same name as the .bam files, just with a different extension. -u , --unique-alignments optional flag If specified, tells degnorm to remove reads aligned to more than one location on the genome. Suggested for use with single end reads data. 2. Genome annotation file DegNorm needs a .gtf file in order to construct the total transcript and compute all per-gene coverage score curves. It is assumed your .gtf file abides by the standard conventions . Argument Required? Meaning -g , --genome-annotation Yes .gtf file for relevant genome. Using a warm start directory Loading multiple .bam files, parsing a .gtf file, and computing per-gene cross-sample coverage matrices and read counts, can take some time, but this is a one-time preprocessing cost given a specific set of RNA-Seq samples. If you run the degnorm pipeline once, you can leverage the stored coverage, read counts, and parsed transcript data from an existing DegNorm output directory to start a a new DegNorm run where all of the preprocessing is completed ahead of time. When using --warm-start-dir you do not need to supply a .gtf file. Argument Required? Meaning --warm-start-dir No A directory holding the contents of a successful previous degnorm pipeline run. When specified, there is no need to supply a .gtf file. Runtime and algorithmic parameters Argument Required? Meaning -o , --output-dir No Defaults to the current working directory. Use to specify location where pipeline output directory will be written. --plot-genes No Names of genes for which to render coverage plots. Sequence of explictly stated gene names or a .txt file containing one gene name per line. -d , --downsample-rate No EXPERIMENTAL. Integer downsampling rate. Systematic samples of a coverage matrix are used to speed up NMF iterations. --nmf-iter No Number of iterations per NMF-OA approximation. The higher the more accurate the approximation, but the more costly in terms of time. --iter No Number of whole DegNorm iterations. Default is 5. --minimax-coverage No Minimum cross-sample maximum coverage for a gene before it is included in the DegNorm pipeline. Can be used to exclude relatively low-coverage genes. -s , --skip-baseline-selection No EXPERIMENTAL. Flag to skip baseline selection, will greatly speed up DegNorm iterations. -p , --proc-per-node No Integer number of processes to spawn per compute node. The more the better. Example usage Run degnorm \"the hard way\" by enumerating each .bam file individually. Suppose we have two alignment files, degnorm_data/GBM/S1.bam and degnorm_data/GBM/S2.bam . If we do not specify any .bai files, degnorm will search for \"degnorm_data/GBM/S1.bai\" and \"degnorm_data/GBM/S2.bai.\" If they cannot be found, they will be created within degnorm_data/GBM if samtools is in your $PATH . degnorm --bam-files degnorm_data/GBM/S1.bam degnorm_data/GBM/S2.bam \\ -g human.gtf \\ -p 20 \\ --nmf-iter 50 \\ -o degnorm_output It's probably just easier to supply degnorm with an input directory (containing multiple .bam files) with 20 threads, use 5 DegNorm iterations and 50 NMF iterations per gene per NMF iteration. Route output to a directory besides the current working directory. degnorm --bam-dir degnorm_data/GBM \\ -g human.gtf \\ -p 20 \\ --nmf-iter 50 \\ -o degnorm_output After one pipeline run, we could start degnorm from the output directory resulting from the first run - this directory is known as the \"warm start\" directory. This time, let's exclude genes with a maximum coverage (across all samples) less than 20, and run DegNorm with only 3 iterations. In this example, DegNorm_102118_081045 was generated automatically from one of the prior DegNorm runs. degnorm --warm-start-dir degnorm_output/DegNorm_102118_081045 \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output \\ --minimax-coverage 20 \\ --iter 3 If the mpi4py python package has been installed (meaning that MPICH is available in your compute environment), try distributing the DegNorm workload over multiple servers (also often referred to as \"nodes\") with degnorm_mpi . You can still specify the number of threads to use within each node with -p . mpiexec -n 4 degnorm_mpi \\ --warm-start-dir degnorm_output/DegNorm_GBM_102018 \\ -p 20 \\ -o degnorm_output \\ --minimax-coverage 20 --nmf-iter 100 The functionality of degnorm_mpi is the same as the single-node degnorm , so you can continue using warm start directories just like you could with degnorm . Output Raw and estimated coverage data are stored in separate .pkl files, one file per chromosome. See the posthoc analysis documentation for helper functions to access coverage data. In addition to per-gene coverage matrices, degnorm will produce raw and degradation-adjusted read counts, a matrix of degradation index scores, a matrix describing which genes were sent through the baseline selection procedure and when, along with various summary graphics and a pipeline summary report.

MPI also allows you to best exploit the embarrassingly parallel nature of the DegNorm workload. See the degnorm_mpi example in the usage docs . Downsampling coverage matrices The backbone of the DegNorm normalization pipeline is the non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation (NMFOA) algorithm. NMFOA is a computationally expensive algorithm, requiring --nmf-iter -many singular value decompositions of the coverage matrix. The SVD is O(n^3) in terms of flop count (according to Trefethen and Bau), so genes with smaller coverage matrices will naturally run through NMFOA faster than larger ones. In an effort to trim down the coverage matrices, the --downsample-rate argument in degnorm allows you to use a systematic sample for each gene's coverage matrix in lieu of the larger original ones. The --downsample-rate is just the integer-valued \"take-every\" step size, so that the original coverage matrix is reduced by a factor of 1 / (downsample rate). At a modest downsampling rate, the overall shape of the coverage curves should still be recognizable. Obviously, the higher the downsampling rate, the faster the DegNorm iterations will complete, because DegNorm executes SVD approximations on smaller and smaller gene coverage matrices.

In comparison to the non-downsampled results (as in, 1/1 downsampling), we see that moderate downsampling - e.g. a rate of 1/20 - does not substantially impact DE analysis and still allow for DegNorm retains its edge over existing RNA-Seq normalization methods, while offering 50%+ DegNorm iteration time savings.

Note that genes with total concatenated exon length less than the downsample rate will not be included in the DegNorm pipeline. Skipping baseline selection The most expensive part of the DegNorm normalization algorithm is in finding a \"baseline\" region of non-degraded coverage across all samples, a process referred to as baseline selection .

We cannot wholly endorse skipping baseline selection, but for those who are seeking ballpark DegNorm results in an hour or two, this option may be for you. Impact The impact of skipping baseline selection is experiment-specific, and is likely due to the nature and extent of RNA degradation present in the samples. As is shown in the figure below, the skipping baseline selection negatively impacts the SEQC AA/AB DE ROC curve. At the same time, DegNorm still retains its advantage over the existing normalization methods with respect to GBM p-value ECDF curves, even while skipping baseline selection.
