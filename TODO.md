## DegNorm TODO

### Frank
- Some exons are shared by multiple genes. Need to eliminate shared regions. If an exon shows up on multiple genes, eliminate it.
- All the other TODO's in run_coverage.py, etc
- Turn DegNorm into an installable package
- Add requirements.txt


### Bin
1. Rewrite NFM R code into python, get it to work for one gene's coverage matrix
