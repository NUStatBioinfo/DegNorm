## Overview


DegNorm, short for **deg**radation **norm**alization is a genomics pipeline that addresses trascript degradation on a (gene, sample)-specific level that can otherwise
substantially bias the results of an RNA-Seq analysis. Most existing global degradation normalization approaches (global in
the sense of being across-genes, across-samples) can be ineffective in correcting RNA degradation bias.

A key result from running DegNorm is the adjustment of read counts for transcript degradation heterogeneity on a per-gene, per-sample
basis while simultaneously controlling for sequencing depth. Underlying the DegNorm pipeline is the rank-one over-approximation of a gene's
**coverage matrix**, or, the matrix of per-sample, per-nucleotide-aligned reads. For each gene DegNorm will estimate an envelope function and
a scale factor for each sample. Samples whose true coverage curve lies well below their estimated coverage curve are considered degraded,
and are assigned a *degradation index score* (or, DI score) of between 0 and 1. Batch effects can be captured by comparing the distribution of DI
scores between samples.

The DegNorm pipeline is comprised of the following steps

1. **Load in RNA-Seq .sam files**. If passed .bam files, DegNorm will attempt to convert them to .sam files if you have `samtools` installed. It will also determine whether the RNA-Seq experiment was obtained from a paired read or single read platform.

2. **Parse a genome annotation file** (.gtf or .gff). DegNorm determines the relative start and end positions of each gene transcript and each exon comprising each gene on each chromosome. Genes occurring on multiple chromosomes and exons occurring on multiple genes are removed. The total number of genes is referred to as `n`.

3. **Compute the chromosome-wide coverage** for each experiment. DegNorm does not use standard coverage tools (e.g. `geneomecov`) that do not take into account paired read overlap when computing coverage - here, every *match* segment of a read's CIGAR score augments nucleotide coverage. For each experiment, for each chromosome, we save coverage in a compressed Numpy array. There are `p` experiments.

4. **Assess per-gene read counts** by counting the number of paired reads falling entirely within the start and end position of every gene. The read count matrix is a `n x p` matrix.

5. **Break up chromosome coverage matrices into per-gene coverage matrices**. Gene matrices are saved to pickle file (a serialized data format for Python), one `.pkl` file per chromosome.

6. **Fit a non-negative matrix factorization with over-approximation** model, as outlined in the central DegNorm paper.

7. **Save** adjusted read counts, gene- and experiment-specific *degradation index scores*, normalized coverage matrices, and coverage visualizations to an output directory.
